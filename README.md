# AI-Gesture-Device
#We are living in a world where people are not equal in terms of physical abilities. We wish to count the ability and not
the disability by lifelong learning. Every disabled person has right to learn and grow through life long learning. The
disability should not be a hurdle to acquire capabilities of lifelong learning. . It is a small AI enabled wearable prototype
for identifying gestures of most of the human activities (HAR- Human Activity Recognition). For life long learning
and creating further capabilities such low cost and easy to use open source hardware can elevate the confidence level of
PWD, The hardware is capable generating alphanumeric characters, words, sentences or controlling any apparatus by
providing required training data for small AI enabled hardware. The technology is open source and uses easy to access
hardware. The device is multifaceted and can be used for old age people to learn even. Human Activity / Gestures A
gesture is a form of non-verbal communication or non-vocal communication in which visible bodily actions
communicate particular messages, either in place of, or in conjunction with, speech. Gestures include movement of the
hands, face, or other parts of the body.


This project has been inspired from the open source Gesture Keyboard project developed by Federico Terezi.
